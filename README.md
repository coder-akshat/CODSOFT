Task 1: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

The objective here is to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors, utilizing regression techniques. 
Historical movie data is analyzed to develop a model that accurately estimates movie ratings given by users or critics. 
This project involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques to gain insights into the factors affecting movie ratings and build a model for accurate rating estimation.

Task 2: Sales Prediction using Python

Sales prediction aims to forecast the amount of a product customers will purchase, considering various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques in Python, businesses can analyze and interpret data to predict future sales, optimizing advertising strategies and maximizing sales potential. 
This task involves utilizing machine learning models to predict sales and make informed decisions regarding advertising costs.

Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

The task involves building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. 
This requires preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. 
Classification algorithms such as logistic regression or random forests are trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, with techniques like oversampling or undersampling used to improve results.
